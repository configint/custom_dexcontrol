"""Wuji Hand adapter for dexcontrol.

Wraps the wuji-sdk to expose the same interface as DexGripper/Hand/
RobotiqGripper so a Wuji Hand (first gen, USB) or Wuji Hand 2 (Ethernet)
can be used as a drop-in end-effector in VegaRobot. Joint space is the
20-element firmware vector (5 fingers x 4 joints, finger-major
thumb/index/middle/ring/pinky), radians.

The two hand generations expose different command channels in wuji-sdk —
first gen drives a low-pass realtime controller, Hand 2 streams MIT
position commands through a joint_command publisher — so the adapter
auto-detects the model at connect time (isinstance(hand, WujiHand2)) and
hides the difference behind set_joint_pos().

Target shaping is the same for both generations: a first-order low-pass
(`lowpass_cutoff_hz`, 5 Hz default) between the caller's targets and the
motors. For first gen the SDK realtime controller applies it while
interpolating to the 1 kHz PDO tick. Hand 2's SDK exposes only the raw MIT
stream, so the adapter applies it itself in the worker (`_shape_hand2`).
Commands are position-only (velocity/effort feedforward 0), exactly like the
vendor's teleop example — which feeds 120 Hz low-passed targets; our callers
send 20 Hz steps (robot server control_hz), which fed raw into a soft,
lightly damped impedance loop lag and ring visibly.

Same worker-thread contract as RobotiqGripper: the cached position is
updated only from real joint_states frames — `set_joint_pos` never writes
the commanded target into the cache. A watchdog stops republishing
commands when the state stream goes silent (USB unplug / link loss) and
resumes when frames come back.

Tactile availability is recorded PER MODEL in TACTILE_BY_MODEL — the current
wuji v1/v2 units ship without tactile hardware (vendor-confirmed), so both
map to False; flip the entry when a tactile-equipped unit arrives. Setting
WUJI_TACTILE=on/off overrides the table (bench experiments). When enabled,
the tactile stream MUST come up (device present + first frame within the
init window) or construction fails loudly: a dataset must never be collected
believing tactile is on while the column silently never arrives.
Schema per hand model when enabled:
  - Wuji Hand v2: 15-vector — per-finger aggregate [fx, fy, fz] (newtons),
    finger-major, decoded from the self-describing fingertip info contract.
  - Wuji Hand v1 (plug-in tactile glove): 40-vector — the pressure frame
    mean-pooled to a fixed 5x8 grid (NaN-invalid cells excluded). Raw frames
    additionally cached when WUJI_TACTILE_RAW=1.
